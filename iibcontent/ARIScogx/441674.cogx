Characterize the genetic mechanisms for controlling nematode resistance for diploid cotton species. 1.A. Genetic characterization of reniform nematode resistance for selected G. arboreum germplasm accessions.  2. Transfer novel nematode resistance identified for diploid cotton species to tetraploid upland cotton. 2.A. Introgression of reniform nematode resistance from G. arboreum germplasm accessions into upland cotton cultivars.  3. Determine environmental influences on nematode infection, development, and reproduction on cotton lines. 3.A. Determine soil temperature effects on nematode infection, development, and reproduction on cotton lines. 3.B. Determine soil moisture effects on nematode infection, development, and reproduction on cotton lines. Develop populations by crossing resistant accessions with one or more Gossypium (G.) arboreum accessions classified as susceptible or highly susceptible to determine the inheritance of the resistance. Ovule culture will be used to introgress resistance from G. arboreum accessions into G. hirsutum varieties. Gossypium accessions with high levels of resistance to reniform nematode will be evaluated in growth chamber experiments to measure the effects of soil temperature and soil moisture stress on the number of infections, rate of development of females after infection, and production of eggs.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
