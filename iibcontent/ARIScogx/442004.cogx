(NP303, C1, PS1A; C2, PS2A, PS2B, PS2C, PS2D) 1.A: Characterize the basic biology of &#195;&#162;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#152;Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las),&#195;&#162;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#153; the bacterium associated with citrus huanglongbing (HLB) by in vitro culture, and characterize new seed-transmissible diseases of citrus. 1.B: Characterize the basic biology, molecular biology, vector interactions and/or epidemiology of orthotospoviruses, Xanthomonas fragariae [cause of angular leaf spot (ALS) on strawberry] and other pathogens of vegetables, citrus, ornamentals, and weeds. Objective 2: Develop and improve reliable detection and sampling methods for pathogens of subtropical and temperate horticultural crops. (NP303, C1, PS1A, PS1B) 2.A: Develop and/or improve detection and sampling methods for orthotospoviruses, Las and Xanthomonas fragariae on strawberry.       2.B: Train canines to detect thrips-transmitted TCSV and whitefly-transmitted SqVYV. Objective 3: Develop or improve comprehensive integrated disease management strategies to mitigate existing or emerging diseases of horticultural crops. (NP303, C3, PS3A, PS3B) 3.A: Develop and implement the most efficacious strategies for disease management of HLB, Xanthomonas fragariae on strawberry, fungal foliar diseases on cucurbits, and viruses of vegetables and ornamentals. 3.B: Develop new and/or augment existing surveillance methods and protocols for HLB and other new citrus diseases, and areawide management of insect-vectored viral diseases of vegetables. The overall approach is to thoroughly characterize plant pathogens causing domestic, exotic and emerging diseases at multiple levels: cellular, molecular and/or biochemical levels of host-pathogen-vector interaction and traditional and newer stochastic epidemiological analysis at field and regional levels.  New pathogens will be identified and characterized by biological and traditional cultural methods.  Recombinant DNA and genomics technologies will be applied to study host-pathogen interactions.  Resulting knowledge will be used to develop new detection and sampling methods, and management strategies, for these pathogens.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
