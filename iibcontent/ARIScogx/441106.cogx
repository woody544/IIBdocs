Sub-objective 1.A: Evaluate boxwood blight in Oregon nurseries.   Sub-objective 1.B: Develop molecular diagnostics and tools to facilitate research on a nematode/virus disease complex.  Objective 2: Understand how pathogen biology and diversity interacts with environmental factors to cause disease of small fruits and nursery crops.  Sub-objective 2.A: Influence of plant spacing and irrigation frequency on the spread of boxwood blight from infected plants to healthy plants. Sub-objective 2.B: Cellular level response of Meloidogyne spp. to nematicides.  Objective 3: Develop chemical and host resistance disease management strategies for nursery crops and small fruits.  Sub-objective 3.A: Evaluate newer fungicide chemistries for control of Phytophthora root rot of rhododendron by sensitivity assays.  Sub-objective 3.B: Novel nematicide discovery: Solanum sisymbriifolium as a source of nematicidal compounds. The long-term goal of this project is to develop sustainable disease management strategies that are based on a knowledge of the identity and biology of the causal agent(s) and on knowledge of pathogen co-infections and interactions with the environment. This will be accomplished by: (1) determining the prevalence of key pathogens and nematodes constraining production of nursery and small fruit crops; (2) understanding how environment and management practices influence disease; and (3) identifying new pesticides for the management of nursery and small fruit diseases.   Knowledge about the prevalence of pathogens and nematodes in agricultural systems is key for establishing effective disease control methods. Surveys will be conducted to assess the incidence of fungal pathogens in nurseries and nematodes in small fruit production fields. Molecular diagnostic tools will further be developed to evaluate the ability of nematodes to vector plant viruses. Pathogen and nematode prevalence is influenced by their response to multiple environmental factors. Therefore, studies will be established to assess the influence of irrigation and plant spacing on the spread of fungal plant pathogens in outdoor container trials, and on the effect of nematicides on nematode fitness in laboratory trials. New pesticide chemistries are also needed because multiple oomycete pathogens have developed resistance to fungicides and many traditional nematicides have been phased out because of harmful environmental and human health effects. New pesticide chemistries will be evaluated for their efficacy against oomycete plant pathogens and nematodes in laboratory, greenhouse and field experiments.   Together, results from this research will identify chemical and nonchemical practices to reduce plant disease, and that can be deployed in horticultural systems in the future.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
