Identify novel sources of resistance to existing and newly emerging soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines, SCN) populations, and develop and deploy new soybean germplasm with broad resistance using traditional and marker-assisted breeding. 1.A. Phenotype Glycine max accessions available in USDA soybean germplasm collection for reaction to SCN populations and evaluate entries in Uniform Soybean Tests, Southern States for resistance to SCN. 1.B. Identify new sources of SCN resistance, pyramid resistance gene(s) for SCN, charcoal rot (CR), and frogeye leaf spot (FLS), and develop germplasm using molecular markers associated with resistance.  2. Determine host-pathogen interactions of fungal diseases in soybeans, including CR and FLS, identify new sources of resistance using improved screening methods, and develop innovative strategies for managing these diseases. 2.A. Identify new resistant soybean genotypes using improved screening methods against virulent pathotypes. 2.B. Evaluate the effects of cultural practices on CR and FLS severity and yield and develop alternate management practices for control of these diseases in soybean. 2.C. Evaluate the mechanism of defense in host pathogen interaction for CR.  3. Develop innovative methods and/or enhance existing methods to assay soil and root infection for improved plant-parasitic nematode detection, identification, and management, and design effective cultural methods for mitigating plant-parasitic nematodes in grower fields. 3.A. Evaluate existing and novel methods to increase detection and screening of plant-parasitic nematodes. 3.B. Determine the impacts of cultural practices and resistance on plant-parasitic and free-living nematodes to ascertain information about soil health and yield. Identify and characterize new sources of resistance to nematode and fungal diseases of soybean that will potentially broaden diversity among resistance genes in soybean cultivars and may provide more durable resistance. New soybean germplasm lines with combined resistance will be developed in maturity groups IV and V with resistance to soybean cyst nematode, root-knot nematode, frogeye leaf spot, charcoal rot, as well as other fungal pathogens. Parasitic and free-living nematode communities will be characterized in soybean fields, especially those with corn and/or cotton in the rotation. New or enhanced methods to detect plant-parasitic nematodes in soil or roots will be developed. Valuable data for the reaction of breeding lines to nematode populations will be available to be utilized by the breeders for potential release to public and private sectors. The new releases in combination with effective cultural practices will also be developed and made available to the public to manage nematode and fungal population shifts.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
