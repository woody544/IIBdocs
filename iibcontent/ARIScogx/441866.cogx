Deployment of root-knot nematode resistance in cotton and peanut. 1.A. Determine the economic value of growing nematode-resistant vs. a susceptible cultivar in continuous and rotated peanut.  1.B. Evaluate the economic effect of growing M. incognita-resistant cotton in fields with damaging levels of the nematode.  2. Identify and screen nematode resistant crops that can be grown in rotation with cotton and peanut.  2.A. Identify sources of resistance to Meloidogyne incognita in sorghum that differ from known sources of resistance.  2.B. Identify sorghum cultivars that are poor hosts for Pratylenchus brachyurus and Meloidogyne arenaria.	  3. Increased understanding of the interactions between plant-parasitic nematodes and the soil microbiology community and how that contributes to disease.  3.A. Evaluate the interactions of nematode parasitism, the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) plant defense pathways, and Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum in the Fusarium wilt disease complex in cotton.  3.B. Investigate the contribution of predatory nematodes in suppressing root-knot nematodes. 3.C. Identify the host and environmental factors that influence the attachment of Pasteuria penetrans spores to Meloidogyne arenaria. The long-term goal of our research is to develop integrated approaches for managing plant-parasitic nematodes in cotton and peanut. Host-plant resistance is the most consistent means of reducing yield losses from nematodes. Our research will investigate the most effective deployment of resistance in cotton and peanut for improving yield and economic returns. For sustainable long-term production, farmers cannot rely solely on host-plant resistance for managing plant-parasitic nematodes. Therefore, we will investigate other management options. We will identify crops that can be grown in rotation with cotton and peanut that will reduce population densities of damaging nematodes. Biological control organisms are being marketed for use in cotton and peanut, and they also occur naturally in fields. We will investigate the contribution of predatory nematodes to suppression of root-knot nematodes and the environmental factors that influence the susceptibility of these nematodes to their host-specific bacterial pathogen, Pasteuria penetrans. Nematodes commonly interact synergistically with other plant pathogens to cause greater crop losses. We will investigate how nematodes interact with cotton&#195;&#162;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#153;s innate defense systems and whether that plays a role in the Fusarium wilt disease complex.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
