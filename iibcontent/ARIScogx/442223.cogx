(C1, PS1A, PS1B)  Objective 2: Develop and apply advanced genomic, phenomic, digital, and bioinformatic research tools to accelerate the progress of hemp research and breeding. (C1, PS1A, PS1B)  Objective 3: Apply knowledge of hemp reproductive traits and advanced genomic approaches to develop logistically-efficient and reliable seed production methods for this crop. (C1, PS1A) A plan will be developed to initiate a new ARS project for hemp research and breeding at Madison, WI in cooperation with collaborators, and coordinated with the ARS hemp genetic resource and genetic enhancement project at Geneva, NY. The ultimate goals of this research and breeding project are to develop new cultivars that will contribute to the profitability of domestic hemp production, and to generate the resilient supply chains required for industrial users of hemp. Research will include comprehensive genomic characterization of hemp genetic resources, genomic structure and function, combined with phenomic evaluations of priority traits that are critical for breeding improved hemp cultivars suitable for diverse industrial applications. This project  will initially begin to develop the infrastructure (facilities, field space, equipment); secure needed permits for research with hemp; establish cooperative agreements; and hire personnel for this new subject of research at the ARS-Madison location. The project will then begin to apply genomic and genetic transformation tools to develop breeding stocks, experimental populations, and datasets to accelerate progress with mapping and elucidating the genetic structure underlying priority traits. Applying these approaches to develop more efficient and effective seed production systems is a specific priority for this dioecious wind-pollinated crop. The genomic and phenotypic datasets generated from this project will be accessible worldwide via GRIN-Global and other data sources to enhance the efficiency of hemp research, breeding and production. Research partnerships, ARS hemp research and genetic enhancement project at Geneva, NY and other cooperators will be strengthened through exchange of information, research tools, and genetic resources. The impact of the research, research tools, hemp genetic diversity datasets, and cultivars developed will be measured in terms of their ability to provide high-value and locally adapted commercial cultivars suitable for industrial fiber, oil, and molecular processing applications.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
