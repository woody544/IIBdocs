(Primarily achieved through Grand Farm and NDSU). (NP 216 C1:PS1A, PS1B; C2:PS2A, PS2B, PS2C)  Objective 2: Develop national level IoT, IT infrastructure, software cybersecurity, and data management standards that can advance the development and deployment of secure, economical, and state-of-the-art climate-smart and precision agriculture technologies. (NP 216 C1:PS1A, PS1B; C2:PS2A, PS2B, PS2C)  Objective 3: Develop national level data management pipelines that facilitates capturing, securing, integrating and appropriate sharing and leveraging of hybrid public-private data sets for enhanced research analytics and improved management decision-making. This will support stakeholder/researcher collaboration and ensure the ability to securely share appropriate management data with researchers while respecting landowner privacy concerns and advance the precision, accuracy, and accessibility of data-driven precision agriculture decision support tools. (NP 216 C1:PS1A, PS1B; C2:PS2A, PS2B, PS2C)  Objective 4: Engage farmers, ranchers, processors, crop consultants, and industry stakeholders on new commercially available and in-development climate-smart and precision agriculture technologies and software products. This engagement will emphasize relevance to farms of all sizes including small, limited resource, and minority producers and processors. These engagements will include field days, training, and high-level support services and other innovative means of technology transfer. This objective will be led by NDSU and Grand Farm. (NP 216 C3: PS3A; PS3B, PS3C) Support the development, assessment, and deployment of high priority IoT and big data tools and analytics for agricultural systems.  Distribute funding to ARS locations to support objectives of the research.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
