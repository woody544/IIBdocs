Objective 2: Investigate the pathobiology of CWD, scrapie prion strains, and atypical TSEs in natural hosts including potential cross species transmission events. Objective 3: Investigate the genetics of CWD susceptibility and resistance in white-tailed deer. Objective 4: Evaluate the presence of and determine the appropriate methodology for CWD strain determination. Eradication or control of a family of diseases is unlikely or impossible when an understanding of the basic mechanisms and influences on transmission are unknown and for which methods to evaluate disease status are lacking. Scrapie and BSE represent the most thoroughly studied TSEs; however, significant knowledge gaps persist with regard to the atypical variants of these diseases. Further, much of the research emphasis to date on genetics of prion disease has focused on the recipient genotype rather than the source. Since both atypical BSE and atypical scrapie have been suggested to occur spontaneously, eradication of these diseases may not be possible unless we expand our understanding of the disease at both the source and recipient level. A better understanding of the tissue distribution and potential transmission of these atypical isolates is critical to understanding what risk these disease variants may pose to ongoing control and eradication efforts. The European epizootic of BSE is waning and efforts to eradicate scrapie in the U.S. and abroad have progressed but are not complete. In the U.S., chronic wasting disease (CWD) presents the most serious challenge to regulatory efforts. CWD appears to be spreading unchecked in both free-ranging and farmed cervids. Methods for antemortem detection of TSEs in general and CWD in particular are needed to fulfill the goal of eradicating scrapie and controlling CWD. Performing these studies will allow us to address critical knowledge gaps that are relevant to developing measures to restrict further disease expansion beyond current, affected populations. Understanding prion disease persistence in animal populations is challenging due to lack of tools for study and a less than complete understanding of transmission among animals within a flock or herd or in naturally occurring reservoirs. In addition to transmission between hosts of like species, free-ranging cervids may come in contact with numerous other species including cattle, sheep, and other susceptible hosts. Transmission of CWD to other species has been studied but limited with regard to the source genotype used. The four primary objectives are inherently linked. Our focus is on developing tools needed for control and research, and using those tools to advance our understanding the complex disease process with the overall goal of eradication and control of disease in livestock, wildlife of economic importance, and potential wildlife reservoirs.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
