Sub-objective 1B: Validate High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) discovery of plant viruses using  biological and molecular techniques.  Objective 2: Develop sensitive, reliable, and resource-efficient methods to detect new and emerging viruses of quarantine significance.  Sub-objective 2A: Develop and/or optimize High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) methods to detect viruses of clonally propagated plant germplasm. Sub-objective 2B: Develop non-HTS methods to detect viruses of clonally propagated plant germplasm. Conduct laboratory and greenhouse research to characterize and detect viruses of clonally propagated plant germplasm.  The emphasis is on crops whose germplasm is subject to federal quarantine regulations and/or are curated by the U.S. National Plant Germplasm System. Conduct biological and molecular studies to characterize poorly described virus and virus-like pathogens of quarantine significance, or diseases of unknown etiology that may be associated with such causal agents. Develop or improve and transfer plant virus detection methods, especially high-throughput sequencing and PCR protocols that detect virus-specific nucleic acids. Use sequencing-based approaches to investigate the genetic diversity of plant viruses, thereby allowing continual improvement and validation of nucleic acid detection protocols.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
