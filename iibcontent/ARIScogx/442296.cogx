Component 5: Problem Statement 5A  Objective 2:  Identify targets for pharmacological, phytochemical, or immunological interventions that could be developed into disease preventives and therapeutics.  Component 5: Problem Statement 5A  Objective 3:  Evaluate mitigation strategies for their potential to prevent horizontal transmission of Histomonas meleagridis in commercial turkeys.  Component 5: Problem Statement 5A We will seek better means to limit the impact of outbreaks by: 1) Testing vaccines for their ability to preventing infection or limiting pathogenesis 2) Enhancing diagnostics and outbreak tracing using genetic tools, 3) Establishing management strategies based on improved understanding of pathogenesis and the parasite life cycle; and 4) Preventing disease by identifying novel pharmaceuticals.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
