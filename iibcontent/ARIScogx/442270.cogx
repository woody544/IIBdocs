Advance the development of veterinary medical countermeasures to detect, prevent, control, and respond to Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) incursions. Objective 2.  Advance the development of veterinary medical countermeasures to detect, prevent, control, and respond to African Swine Fever (ASF) incursions. The mission of the BDM is to provide research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&amp;E), and technical services necessary to advance through the early development stage, veterinary medical countermeasures (MCM) for a broad array of animal and public health threats.  The BDM program at NBAF plays a critical role in bridging the gap to decrease risk for private sector investments in agro- and biodefense MCM development.  Mitigating the risk for private sector investments in MCM development for foreign animal diseases is paramount since there is no commercial market for diseases that technically, do not exist in the United States, but pose a significant threat to animal agriculture and public health.  Importantly, the BDM directly supports APHIS&#195;&#162;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#153;s roles and responsibilities related to veterinary public health and food defense associated with emerging and zoonotic high consequence pathogens.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
