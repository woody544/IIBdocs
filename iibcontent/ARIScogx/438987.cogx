Objective 2: Reduce nutrient losses from replacement dairy heifer production  through management strategies that target nutrient use efficiency and growth  performance. Pressures facing modern dairy operations, including high input costs, and uncertain milk and commodity prices have led to renewed interest in less intensive production practices. Improvements in the production efficiencies in dairy production can impact sustainability of dairy operations. The proposed research will focus on impacts of utilization of perennial forages, as well as novel annual species for providing alternative uses in modern dairy operations. The approach is collaborative, including contributions from the University of Wisconsin Marshfield Agricultural Research Station (UW-MARS), UW-Madison, UW-Extension, USDA-NRCS, and the University of Florida, among others. The approach also consists of experimental field work. Field work is based on continued use and development of field facilities at UW-MARS. This work impacts dairy and forage production systems in the upper Midwest and elsewhere. Products and outcomes consist of best management practices for grazing and forage management; fundamental knowledge about soil health and function, and forage productivity; and environmental impacts of grazing production. Stakeholders include dairy or beef cattle producers, extension agents, as well as other public agencies.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
