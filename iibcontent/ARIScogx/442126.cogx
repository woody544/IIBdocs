Sub-objective 1.A: Improve crop coefficients for reference ET models that are reliable along the sugarcane life cycle and across sugarcane growing areas in U.S. with differing climatic zones and water regimes, including deficit and excess-water conditions. Sub-objective 1.B: Improve ET models for water management at field to regional level by separating transpiration and soil evaporation fluxes using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in water.  Objective 2: Develop holistic stochastic optimization models and decision support tools to improve the sustainability of sugarcane production systems in temperate environments.  Objective 3: Evaluate and/or develop conservation best management practices that positively influence soil water and carbon cycling in sugarcane production systems in temperate environments. Sub-objective 3.A: Characterize how long-term (16+ y) sugarcane crop residue management affects soil moisture storage, C sequestration, and crop yield. Sub-objective 3.B: Characterize how new tillage and fallow cover cropping practices affect soil moisture storage, C sequestration, and crop yield. Through greenhouse and field experiments, improve crop coefficients for reference evapotranspiration (ET) models that are reliable along the sugarcane life cycle and across sugarcane growing areas in U.S. with differing climatic zones and water regimes, including deficit and excess-water conditions; and Improve ET models for water management at field to regional level by separating transpiration and soil evaporation fluxes using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in water. Employ data collected in the field to populate DSSAT input modules to evaluate how changing climatic conditions will affect sustainable sugarcane production. Characterize how long-term (16+ y) sugarcane crop residue management affects soil moisture storage, carbon sequestration, and crop yield. Characterize how new tillage and fallow cover cropping practices affect soil moisture storage, carbon sequestration, and crop yield.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
