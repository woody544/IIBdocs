Develop and implement acoustic based methods for measurement and interpretation of sediment transport in streams. 1.A. Develop novel methods for data analysis and visualization to aid interpretation of acoustic sedimentation data while continuing to develop sediment transport measurement technologies. 1.B. Engage in CEAP/LTAR research by implementing existing acoustic sediment monitoring technology in CEAP/LTAR watershed.  2. Develop and adapt acoustic and geophysical methods for characterizing soils and monitoring processes within the agricultural watershed. 2.A. Develop an acoustic based soil water status assessment tool for improving water management and irrigation and rain fed decision support systems. 2.B. Develop rapid and noninvasive agrogeophysical methods for mapping and monitoring erosional processes (e.g., soil pipes in relation to gully erosion) in agricultural landscapes. 2.C. Application of geophysical measurements for estimating groundwater flow, aquifer parameters, and aquifer thickness. 2.D. Development of relationships between soil properties and geophysical attributes using machine learning. Development of acoustic and geophysics technology addressing gaps in the USDA's suite of tools to map and monitor hydraulic processes over a range of time and space scales will consist of: theoretical and modeling efforts, controlled laboratory experiments, and field measurements using the newly developed hardware and techniques. Theoretical and modeling efforts establish the feasibility and sensitive of acoustic attributes to soil processes and sediment transport. Laboratory measurements help to better understand the physics of soils and its interaction with water and determine optimal sensor configurations, data quality requirements, and data processing schemes. Field measurements provide the final proof of concept design and incorporation into USDA applications. The first objective relates to the development of novel methods for data analysis and visualization to aid interpretation of acoustic sedimentation data while continuing to develop sediment transport measurement technologies. The second objective relates to acoustic and geophysical methods that can monitor and evaluate the performance of agricultural irrigation, drainage, and rain-fed systems, improve technology for studying soil pipe development, and to assess suitable sites and monitor the efficacy of surface water to groundwater interaction. Both parties are actively engaged in independent research projects related to the development and use of acoustic/ seismic technology for water resources applications. The parties agree that meeting the objectives of this project will expand the suite of tools, technology, and sensors for acquiring data to support science-based decision support systems.</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
