Develop physically based multidimensional numerical models and technology for watershed erosion and sediment transport processes, water quality issues due to agro-pollution, and surface-groundwater interactions in agriculture landscapes. 1.1. Expand CCHE1D model capabilities. 1.2. Simulate rain-induced watershed soil erosion over tilled and non-tilled agricultural land and sediment transport. 1.3. Develop a coupled surface-subsurface water model.  1.4. Improve CCHE water quality and pollutant transport models.  2. Enhance the Decision Support System for the web-based Agricultural Integrated Management System (AIMS) by integrating watershed and channel network technology with geospatial and remote sensing data for effective watershed runoff, sediment, and water quality management. 2.1. Improve AIMS and AnnAGNPS integration. 2.2. Integrate CCHE1D channel network delineation model and multiple-scaled channel networks and flow model into AIMS. 2.3. Develop assessments of the AIMS integrated technology with case studies. 2.4. Explore cloud computing capability for AIMS. In order to better assess and predict the direct impacts of water availability and soil erosion from agricultural fields, gullies and channels, existing technology must be developed and upgraded to assess and improve predictions for more realistic conditions. This includes technology that is needed for decision making in identifying, targeting and implementing conservation practices that protect the landscape. The first objective of the project plan focuses on the development and improvement of numerical models associated with watershed erosion and sediment transport processes, water quality issues due to agro-pollution, and surface-groundwater interactions in agriculture landscapes. This objective relates to the ARS National Program Action 211, Component 1 (Effective Water Management in Agriculture) and Component 2 (Erosion, Sedimentation, and Water Quality Protection). The second objective focuses on the development and improvement of a watershed management tools to assess runoff, sediment, and water quality conservation practice impacts. This objective is related to NP 211 Component 1 and Component 4 (Watershed Management to Improve Agroecosystem Services).</text></content><metadata><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="articleTitle"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata><metadata zone="Abstract"><a name="language" value="English" /></metadata></doc></cogito>
