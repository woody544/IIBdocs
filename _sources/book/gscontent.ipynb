    "\n",
    "1. Check the IIB-CSE-PROJECT-TRACKER.xlsx file to identify CSE batches ready to merge their respective CSE projects. Projects are ready to merge when ALL indexers have completed their projects for the batch. CSE Projects circled below are ready to merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "fig. 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In CSE, open each IIB indexer’s completed CSE project, one at a time.\n",

    "fig. 2 (series of 5 images of CSE project blocks)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the open CSE project, go to the ‘Documents’ tab.\n",

    "fig 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Select the down-arrow icon circled below, and click on ‘COGX (x docs)  (x = the number of docs in the CSE project). \n",
    "\n",
    "fig. 4\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Save to the AnnotationData repository, in ‘Cogito-SAMPLE-HI-INDEXER-CSE-exports’ directory. ONLY ONE BATCH (project set) should be in this directory when you start the merge code!!\n",
    "\n",
    "fig. 5\n",

    "## PART 2: RUN THE GOLDEN SET MERGE CODE AS SHOWN\n",
    "\n",
    "7. You should have both the AnnotationData and the DataProcessing repositories cloned to your local PC at the same level, and up to date (pull first). \n",
    "\n",
    "8. The project configuration for your files should be:\n",
    "--myGithubs\n",
    "----AnnotationData\n",
    "----DataProcessing\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Open up a GitBash window in your local DataProcessing repository. (Assumes you have cloned this repository to your local machine, and have set up GitBash. If you have not, please do so.)\n",
    "Right click on the DataProcessing folder, select ‘GitBash Here’\n",

    "      i.   Type git pull to ensure your branch is up to date (Also, git status to see if you have an local changes that need to be committed.)\n",
    "      ii.  Check branches if needed git branch\n",
    "      iii. Create a new branch if needed git branch golden_cse\n",
    "      iv.  Switch to a golden set branch for this task git checkout golden_cse \n",
    "      v.   Note the prompt in the GitBash window shows you are no longer in the main branch. \n",

    "fig. 7\n",
    "\n",
    "      vii. Keep this bash window open.\n",

    "\n",
    "11. While on the branch (GitBash window still up), from the Idle Shell you just opened, click ‘File’ to open the python file ~ \\DataProcessing\\GoldenSetMergeProcessing\\goldensetmerge.py\n",
    "\n",
    "fig. 9\n",

    "12. In the open goldensetmerge.py python file, select Run >Run Module… it will automatically find the indexers CSE project files you previously exported to \n",

    "\n",
    "CAUTION: At this point, you should have ONLY one Batch represented with the exported zip files. So, if 5 indexers completed individual files, then you should have ONLY five zip files in this directory before you run the code (directory image not shown here). The code will provide output to monitor the process in the GitBash, and in the python shell. Keep them all up, and do not close them! Once the code is running, there is nothing you need to do until it completes.\n",

    "15. Only zip files still needing to be merged should be stored directly in GS-merged-CSE-assigned directory, i.e. only ONE BATCH, or set, of CSE project files should be in this directory when you start the merge code.\n",

Once the CSE Goldenset project is complete, and you have verified that the documents look and annotations look correct; DELETE EACH of the individual indexer CSE projects for that batch number. If there is a prompt to remove the backup, select it, then CONFIRM. Do not delete more than two at a time to avoid memory errors from the server.\n",
